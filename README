Convenience Java class for generating pptx Powerpoint files using the open-source,
powerful, but ill-documented docx4j. Written after piecing together info and code
from all over the place.

Still something of a WIP, but it works. Initially worked on for a client, but it didn't
turn out to be necessary in the end, so I never really wrapped it up.
